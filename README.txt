Title: Sudoku Puzzle Solver Web App

Overview: This project involves the design and development of a web application that allows users to solve sudoku puzzles using axios and the RapidAPI platform. The app was built with JavaScript, Node.js, HTML, and CSS, and it utilizes a back-end server implemented in Node.js to securely store the API key and make requests to the RapidAPI service.

Features:

-User interface for entering sudoku puzzles and displaying the solution
-Integration with the RapidAPI sudoku solver service via axios
-Back-end server for handling API requests and protecting the API key

Technical details:

-The front-end of the app was built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using a modern web framework such as React or Vue.js.

-The back-end server was implemented using Node.js and Express, and it serves as a proxy for making requests to the RapidAPI service. It also handles the storage and protection of the API key, using secure methods such as environment variables or a configuration file.

-The app communicates with the RapidAPI service using axios, a popular JavaScript library for making HTTP requests. Axios allows the app to send and receive data from the service in a convenient and efficient manner.

Conclusion: The Sudoku Puzzle Solver Web App is a functional and user-friendly tool that leverages the power of axios and the RapidAPI platform to provide a fast and accurate solution to sudoku puzzles. Its modular design and use of modern web technologies make it scalable and maintainable, making it a valuable addition to any puzzle-solver's toolkit.
